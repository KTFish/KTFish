| [Petrol Prices](https://github.com/KTFish/petrol-prices-object-detection) object detection with YOLO | The solution was supposed to "help" the driver decide whether to refuel the car at the station. At the moment, the model detects individual prices with varying effectiveness and is quite good at detecting the entire price pylon. Ultimately, it will be able to recognize the type of fuel and compare the current price with the previous ones. I used the ultralytics library (an implementation of the YOLO model) and _Weights and Biases_ to monitor the experiments, the project is still unfinished. Still working on it! |
| [Classification of tires](https://github.com/KTFish/tire-classification-pytorch/tree/main) | Simple model for tire classification with **Pytorch**. |
| [MNIST](https://github.com/KTFish/MNIST) | Exploration of the MNIST classfication problem that I presented for educational purposes during a prelection at Artificial Intelligence Society ,,Czarna Magia'' at Univerisity of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. |
| [Prolog with Python - University Project](https://github.com/KTFish/Prolog-Project) | Project realized for the subject Declarative Programming at Univeristy of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn together with my colleague [@Zeusthegoddd](https://github.com/Zeusthegoddd) |
| [AiSD On Steroids](https://github.com/KTFish/AiSD-On-Steroids) | Algorithms and Data Structures is a subject taught during the 3rd semester of Computer Science at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. Because many students have problems with passing it, together with members of KNSI Czarna Magia I decided to prepare a repository to support students in gaining knowledge about algorithms.|
| [GAN](https://github.com/KTFish/GANs)s | Repository combining all my work related to GANs (learning, projects, gits). |
