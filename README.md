| [Petrol Prices](https://github.com/KTFish/petrol-prices-object-detection) object detection with YOLO | The solution was supposed to "help" the driver decide whether to refuel the car at the station. At the moment, the model detects individual prices with varying effectiveness and is quite good at detecting the entire price pylon. Ultimately, it will be able to recognize the type of fuel and compare the current price with the previous ones. I used the ultralytics library (an implementation of the YOLO model) and *Weights and Biases* to monitor the experiments, the project is still unfinished.   Still working on it! |
